# MyOS
A modular, forkable Personal Web OS â€” build your own digital workspace with customizable tools, JSON-based data, and a fully static architecture.

--- 

MyOS is an open-source, client-only web framework that turns a simple static site into a customizable personal operating system.

Designed to run entirely on GitHub Pages using only HTML, CSS, JSON, and JavaScript, it features a modular system that lets you plug in independent tools â€” each hosted in its own repo â€” and manage everything through a single JSON file for customizability.

Anyone can fork the project, edit the JSON config, and instantly create their own unique digital workspace that works seamlessly across devices.

ðŸ§© Key Features:

Modular design â€” tools are independent and hot-swappable

JSON-based data storage â€” no backend or localStorage required

Fully static â€” works right on GitHub Pages or any static host

Fork-ready â€” personalize your workspace with zero setup

Extensible plugin ecosystem â€” build your own modules easily

ðŸš€ Vision:
To create an open, community-driven standard for personal web environments â€” a digital OS you own, control, and customize.
